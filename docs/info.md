## How it works

This neuron model is an adaptive leaky integrate and fire neuron. It behaves similarly to a traditional leaky integrate and fire neuron(LIF), but takes into consideration the frequency of spikes occurring. In other words, if a simple LIF were to spike at a consistent rate, the adaptive LIF model will spike less often over time.

## How to test

## External hardware

There is no external hardware for this model.
